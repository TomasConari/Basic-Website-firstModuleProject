                                main causes of climate change is the emission of greenhouse
                                gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
                                and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere,
                                causing global temperatures to rise.<br>

                            Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it

                                contribute to climate change. Livestock emit methane, a potent
                                greenhouse gas, while fertilizers release nitrous oxide, another
                                greenhouse gas. Plowing can also release carbon from the soil into
                                the atmosphere.

                                change. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide, while
                                manufacturing processes emit other greenhouse gases such as sulfur
                                hexafluoride and hydrofluorocarbons.

                                and airplanes releases large amounts of greenhouse
                                gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.

                            <strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Another
                            important strategy is to increase energy
                            efficiency in buildings, transportation,
                            and industrial processes. This can reduce
                            the amount of energy needed to power these
                            systems, which in turn reduces greenhouse
                            gas emissions.

                            capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that
                            captures carbon dioxide emissions from power
                            plants and industrial processes and stores
                            them underground. This can significantly
                            reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

                            Adapting infrastructure to be more resilient
                            to climate change impacts such as floods,
                            sea level rise, and extreme weather events
                            is a critical adaptation strategy. This can
                            involve constructing sea walls, elevating
                            buildings, and improving drainage systems.

                            regulating water flows, storing carbon, and
                            providing habitat for biodiversity. Protecting
                            and restoring ecosystems can provide important
                            benefits for climate change adaptation.

                            adaptation strategy. This can involve developing
